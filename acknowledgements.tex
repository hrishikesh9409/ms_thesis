I would like to thank the Informatics department for providing all the support and guidance. I thank my advisor, Prof. Henry Muccini heartily for his invaluable mentorship. I offer my salutations to the dissertation committee, and my research collaborators for their insightful input. I would also like to thank the members of the research group, for providing me so many opportunities to learn and grow. 

I finally thank the Amrita University and University of L'Aquila for selecting me for the I2Cost Dual Degree program that has catapulted me thus far and is continuing to do so.
