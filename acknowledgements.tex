I would like to thank the Informatics department for providing all the support and guidance.I would like to thank my parents, without whom my life would not be possible. I would also like to thank my advisor, my dissertation committee, and my research collaborators because every graduate student needs to do so. And finally, I thank the members of the research group, for providing me so many opportunities to learn and grow. 

I finally thank the Amrita University and University of L'Aquila for selecting me for the I2Cost Dual Degree program that has catapulted me thus far and is continuing to do so.
