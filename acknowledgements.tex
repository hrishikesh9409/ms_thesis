I would like to thank the Informatics department for providing all the support and guidance. I thank my advisor, Prof. Henry Muccini heartily for his invaluable mentorship. I offer my salutations to the dissertation committee, and my research collaborators for their insightful input. I would also like to thank my co-supervisor Mahyar Moghaddam and the other members of the research group, for providing me so many opportunities to learn and grow. 

I finally thank the University of L'Aquila and Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham for selecting me for the I2Cost Dual Degree program that has catapulted me thus far and is continuing to do so.
