\section{Future Work}

This work can be extended to non-standard buildings with additional constraints in future. The internet of things (IoT) helps in locating the number of persons in each block and their location (cell numbers) which can then be dynamically fed in for optimisation in real time. When such data can be obtained in real time, the simulation can then be shifted from design time to a real time egress path evaluation.
